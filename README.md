# FizzBuzz Playground

By [Thanh Huynh]

## Description
Two different solutions to the fizzbuzz problem. First solution is a method that prints "fizz" when a number that is divisable by 3, "buzz" when a number that is divisable by 5, and "fizzbuzz" when a number that is divisable by 5 and 3 is inputed in the method.
The second solution is more open. The user can add their own rules and messages as they wish.
